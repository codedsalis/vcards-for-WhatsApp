Users fill the form on the website.. Which makes up the compiled contact

At the end of each day, the compiled contacts are to be converted to Vcf and uploaded on the download page where users can download it

There can be a place where all previous files will be available for download

Free users have to share the embedded messages to be able to download the file,
But premium users won't have to

After filling a form, a password should be generated for the free user's
Which will be used to have access to the download page,
After having access to the page
When they click download,
They will be required to share an embedded message to 15contacts
Before the download starts
But premium users password gives them instant download access

No signing up,
Password differentiates free from premium

The system Should generate 2 different password each day. One is for Free, Other is For Premium 


If they want to fill the form, 
they'd have to select Free or Premium
If they select Free:
Maximum Character they can enter for the Whatsapp Name will be 8
They can't give Gap in their entries for the Whatsapp name

If they select premium:
Unlimited characters
Can give Gap and enter multiple words

I don't know how it can work, but the idea is that,
Buy 9pm every day, all contacts for that day will be compiled and available for download
Then the previous days file will move to something like "previous files"

It will be available for people who have the password
